# Effectiveness of Tertiary Care Outpatient Psychological Interventions; A Benchmarking Study  {.unlisted .unnumbered}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Psychological therapies are an essential part of public healthcare in the UK, available through the National Health Service [NHS, @DepartmentofHealth2004]. There is considerable support for the efficacy of psychological therapy from controlled trials (Roth & Fonagy, 1996). The effectiveness of such therapies in routine or naturalistic settings has also been repeatedly supported via meta-analyses [e.g. @Cahill2010; @Stewart2009; @Wakefield2021a]. While there is now consensus that psychological therapy is an effective treatment for a range of disorders, questions remain regarding which factors and conditions serve to enhance or hinder effectiveness. One factor considered to strongly influence therapy outcome is the context (or sector) in which treatment is delivered and the complexity of the presenting problems  [@Firth2020a; @Lambert2001a; @Paley2008a; @Smith1977].

## Sectors

Within the NHS, health-care delivery is organised through a range of tiers, otherwise known as sectors. Primary care, which accounts for the largest proportion of UK therapy delivery, offers interventions which are brief or ‘time-limited’ for individuals who have mild-to-moderate (low intensity psychological intervention indicated) and moderate-to-severe (high intensity psychological intervention indicated) levels of common mental health difficulties. Patients with greater complexity or who have not responded to treatment in primary care are referred to secondary or tertiary care services. These populations with chronic common mental problems have been described as being ‘treatment resistant’ and requiring specialist psychological interventions [@Taylor2012].
Despite the differences between care sectors regarding therapy delivery, the body of supporting evidence for NHS psychological therapy is overwhelmingly based upon primary and secondary care services. There is a relative lack of evidence for the effectiveness of tertiary care services and how they compare to other sectors. Tertiary care therapy services have been characterized as being in high demand, but lacking both resources and supporting practice-based evidence [@Warden2008]. The three primary reasons for lack of evidence are (a) services are few in number, (b) outcome studies failing to label when therapies are delivered in these services and (c) when tertiary care outcomes are reported in such studies there is often high levels of missing data [up to 95%, @Firth2020a]. The final reason also motivates researchers to omit tertiary care samples from multi-sector analyses due to concerns around selection bias [see @Stiles2006 for an example].

## Tertiary Care Services

Tertiary care therapy services are highly underrepresented in the UK, are few in number, cover wide geographical regions and offer more resource intensive interventions than those provided within primary care. For example, cognitive-behavioural psychotherapies, although provided within primary care, are often available for longer durations within tertiary care services. Examples of other treatments provided in tertiary care services include: dynamic interpersonal therapy [DIT, @Douglas2016a], intensive short-term dynamic interpersonal therapy [ISTDP, @Johansson2014], cognitive analytic therapy [CAT, @Ryle2020], psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy [PIT, @Paley2008a] and psychoanalytic psychotherapy [@Warden2008].

Those few studies which have provided evidence for tertiary outcomes have tended to analyse outcomes for a small number of patients. @Paley2008a explored the effectiveness of psychodynamic interpersonal therapy with 47 tertiary care patients and @Douglas2016a explored the effectiveness of dynamic interpersonal therapy with 28  patients. There are no other published instances of practice-based evidence for UK tertiary care therapy and this stands in comparison to UK primary care therapy datasets samples of greater than 100,000 patients [e.g., @Delgadillo2016, N = 110,415].

Outside of the UK, there has been greater representation of tertiary care practice-based evidence in larger samples. This originates in Canadian outcome studies exploring the effectiveness of intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) in a single tertiary care psychotherapy service [@Abbass2008; @Johansson2014; @Lilliengren2020a; @Nowoweiski2020]. Each of these studies has provided support for the effectiveness of psychological therapy delivered within tertiary care services. For example, @Johansson2014 observed a large reduction in general psychological distress (*d* = 0.87, N = 412). Caution is required in generalising these findings to UK tertiary care services as there are various differences between UK and Canadian services (e.g. funding structure, clinician training) and further potential differences between patient groups (e.g. presenting problem, treatment received). 
While there are also a small number of tertiary care therapy samples from other countries, they have generally focused on specialist populations, such as chronic fatigue [@Heins2011; @Worm-Smeitink2016] and autism [@Blainey2017].

## The Type and Duration of Interventions
One of the main differences between NHS care sectors is the treatment provided. There has been an overwhelming amount of attention within the psychotherapy literature exploring differential rates of effectiveness between therapy modalities. Reviews of efficacy trials have consistently shown that bona fide psychotherapeutic interventions tend to have highly similar treatment outcomes [@Wampold1997]; this common finding has since been referred to as the equivalence paradox [@Rosenzweig1936]. It has subsequently been argued that excessive attention to comparing different ‘brands of therapy’ [@Johns2019] has scarcely moved the area forward. While this finding has shown to be robust when averaging across multiple populations/studies there is evidence that in specific circumstances certain treatments perform better than others [e.g., @Delgadillo2020a].
As tertiary care services in the UK are considered to represent a distinct group of patients with more severe, enduring disorders, it could be that these more complex patients have significant differential responses to particular treatments. Knowledge of differential response to treatment could inform treatment selection decisions; this is particularly relevant for patients accessing tertiary care treatments, as they have typically accessed and not responded to previous psychological treatments [@Taylor2012]. No study has yet explored potential differences between bona fide psychotherapeutic interventions within a UK tertiary care service.

Studying how treatment duration influences effectiveness can provide valuable information regarding 'dose-response' relationships [@Howard1986]. Such information is very pertinent to tertiary care provision due to the lengthier treatments offered. A review of the dose-response literature for psychological therapy in routine settings found strong support for a curvi-linear relationship between sessions and effectiveness [@Robinson2020]. In other words, effectiveness shows a negatively accelerating rate of change. The review estimated that an optimal dosage for routine settings is 4-26 sessions, but that this will vary based on setting, population, and outcome measure.
The review also found there to be scarce, inconclusive evidence for chronic/severe patient samples and little evidence to support long-term therapy beyond 30 sessions. This is pertinent to tertiary care services as longer treatment durations are provided on the notion that more complex presentations require longer treatment durations. Some support for this claim has been provided through early studies demonstrating that patients with chronic and characterological symptoms may require longer treatment durations in order to reach a comparable response rate [@Howard1986] and that interpersonal problem resolution may lag behind symptom improvement [@Kopta1994]. There is no empirical evidence available for optimal treatment dosage within UK tertiary services, and only limited evidence for services which provide long form treatments [@Robinson2020].

To summarise, there is a distinct lack of evidence for the effectiveness of UK tertiary care psychotherapy services using a validated outcome measures and with an adequately sized sample of tertiary care patients. This study aimed to primarily provide a quantifiable benchmark of tertiary care effectiveness and establish rates of recovery and deterioration. The secondary aim was to explore how change occurs over time (i.e. growth trajectories) and compare outcomes between three routinely delivered therapies. It was hypothesized that (1) service effectiveness outcomes would be comparable to benchmarks, (2) there would be no significant difference in pre-post outcomes between treatments and (3) outcome trajectories would be comparable across the treatments.
