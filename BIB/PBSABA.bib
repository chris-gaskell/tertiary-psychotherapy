  abstract = {One of the most serious problems facing families and care staff concerns the treatment of extremely behaviourally disturbed individuals with an intellectual disability. Frequently these people are termed ``dual-diagnosed'' or with ``challenging behaviour.'' The kinds of behaviour which present in this group can be broadly described as extremely aggressive either in their environment, to others (parents, staff, and other residents), to themselves (self-injurious behaviour which in its extreme forms are life threatening), or who are so withdrawn that living with others is unbearable. Treatment is often only possible in closed facilities and with special medication, as the prognosis for community living and social acceptance is extremely poor. In this article some theoretical material on a psychodynamic orientation concerning the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness in this group is presented. Four cases concerning long term treatment are then described\textemdash an extremely aggressive young man with a mild intellectual disability, a young man with multiple disabilities whose behaviour is destructive, a very withdrawn young woman with life threatening self-destructive behaviour, and a young autistic man with a broad spectrum of extremely uncontrollable behaviour. Finally, the success and limitations of the approach are discussed.},

Aims               To evaluate whether such training is clinically effective in reducing challenging behaviour during routine care (trial registration: NCT01680276).                                         Method                                We carried out a multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial involving 23 community intellectual disability services in England, randomly allocated to manual-assisted staff training in PBS (                 n                 = 11) or treatment as usual (TAU,                 n                 = 12). Data were collected from 246 adult participants.                                                        Results               No treatment effects were found for the primary outcome (challenging behaviour over 12 months, adjusted mean difference = -2.14, 95\% CI: -8.79, 4.51) or secondary outcomes.                                         Conclusions               Staff training in PBS, as applied in this study, did not reduce challenging behaviour. Further research should tackle implementation issues and endeavour to identify other interventions that can reduce challenging behaviour.

  abstract = {Background According to several comprehensive systematic and narrative reviews, interventions based on applied behaviour analysis principles, or behaviour analytic interventions, are considered evidence based for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, no comprehensive review of the literature related to behaviour analytic interventions for children with intellectual disability (ID) currently exists. Methods Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (registration ID: CRD42018099317), the purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the relevant published literature on the use of behaviour analytic interventions to develop skills in young children (0\textendash 8 years) with ID (and without ASD). A preliminary search of the literature identified 1209 potential studies published between January 2000 and April 2020. The review process resulted in 48 articles consisting of 49 studies (i.e. one paper contained two studies) that met the inclusion criteria. Most used single-case research designs. Studies were evaluated on five dimensions of methodological quality based on the Scientific Merit Rating Scale developed by the National Autism Center (NAC). The NAC definitions were also used for the quantity and quality of research evidence required for interventions to be considered established or emerging. Results There were a number of limitations to the quality of the body of research. Nevertheless, various behaviour analytic interventions met criteria for being established interventions when used for targeting communication, adaptive and pre-academic skills in young children with ID. Behaviour analytic interventions targeting academic skills met criteria for emerging interventions. Conclusions Although the current literature is limited, results indicate that behaviour analytic interventions may be effectively used to support skill development in children with ID.},

  abstract = {Background Positive behaviour support (PBS) is behaviour analysis applied in support of people with challenging behaviour. Questions have been raised as to PBS effectiveness, costs, and accessibility. Method Outcome studies meeting specified criteria for PBS were selected for review. All told, 12 outcome studies encompassing 423 cases were included. Results This review showed that PBS was effective with both severe and high-rate behaviour problems, was cost-effective, used a methodology that was easily trained and widely disseminated, and worked in institutional settings in which the most difficult problems are thought to be, as well as in the community. Conclusions The major implication of this review is that practitioners may be obligated to use PBS when faced with the need to develop a plan of support given the ethical principle of using the least restrictive method consistent with the right to effective treatment.},

  abstract = {A controversy has emerged about the relationship between positive behavior support and applied behavior analysis. Some behavior analysts suggest that positive behavior support and applied behavior analysis are the same (e.g., Carr \& Sidener, 2002). Others argue that positive behavior support is harmful to applied behavior analysis (e.g., Johnston, Foxx, Jacobson, Green, \& Mulick, 2006). Further, some proponents of positive behavior support describe it as a new science, evolved from yet different than applied behavior analysis (Carr et al., 2002). These varying positions have accompanied confusion among behavior analysts about positive behavior support and its impact on the field. This article attempts to clarify this confusion by presenting one perspective on positive behavior support and its relationship to applied behavior analysis.},
