In a tertiary psychotherapy service, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP) medication use, and need for further treatment were evaluated before versus 1-month post trial therapy in a sequential series of 30 clients. Trial therapies were interviews with active focus on emotions and how they are experienced. The interviews resulted in statistically significant improvements on all BSI subscales and one of the IIP subscales. One-third of clients required no further treatment, seven stopped medications, and two returned to work following trial therapy. The ISTDP trial therapy appeared to be clinically effective and cost effective. Future research directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

In the current chapter, we reflect on the assumptions underlying evidence-based practice and consider the benefits of broadening this paradigm to include a wider constituency of evidence, particularly in relation to what we call practice-based evidence. Our aim is to argue that although trials methodology has contributed much to the evidence base on effective treatments, questions remain concerning the underlying assumptions of evidence-based practice. Our proposition is that there is an alternative, broader foundation for deciding the relevance of research to practice that, combined with trials methodology, can yield a more robust knowledge base for practitioners and services. We first set out a vision of a broader research perspective as documented in several key strategic texts. Second, we consider the randomized controlled trial (RCT) together with a range of design and methodological issues associated with it. Third, we present a r\'esum\'e of practice-based research together with its virtues and vulnerabilities. And finally, we suggest models for bringing together, in differing ways, the strengths of trials methodology and practice-based studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

To explore the effect of individual characteristics and service factors on change in general distress. Method: In a specialist psychological therapies service for adults with ASC, the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) self-report questionnaire of psychological distress is completed by clients at start and end of therapy. Change over time and reliable and clinical change was assessed for 81 of a total of 122 clients (66.4\%). Factors which may influence change over time were explored using available clinical information. Results: Overall, there was a significant reduction in CORE-OM score during therapy with a small effect size. Most clients showed an improvement in psychological distress over therapy (75.4\% improved, with 36.9\% of these showing reliable changes). Significant and comparable reductions from pre-therapy to post-therapy were seen across the sample, showing that individual differences did not mediate therapy effectiveness. CORE-OM scores mediate the association between age of ASD diagnosis and hours of therapeutic input required, with greater age at diagnosis and higher distress associated with longer therapy duration. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that psychological therapy may be effective in reducing general distress for clients with ASC and co-morbid mental health conditions and should be routinely offered. Individuals who are diagnosed with ASD in adulthood are likely to require a longer course of therapy when their general distress scores are high.},

  abstract = {The "good-enough level" (GEL) model proposes that people respond differentially to psychotherapy, and that the typical curvilinear "dose-response" shape of change may be an artifact of aggregation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the GEL literature to examine (a) whether different subgroups of adults accessing psychotherapy respond to therapy at different rates and (b) whether the shape of change is linear or nonlinear. This review was preregistered on PROSPERO. Fifteen studies were synthesized (n = 114,123), with 10 included across two meta-analyses (n = 46,921; n = 41,515). Systematic searches took place using Medline, PsycINFO and Scopus databases. A key inclusion criterion was that cases must be stratified by treatment length to examine the GEL. In support of the GEL, there was no overall association between treatment duration and outcomes (r = -0.24, 95\% confidence interval [CI: -0.70, 0.36], p = .27). Longer treatments were associated with higher baseline symptom scores (r = 0.15, 95\% CI [0.08, 0.22], p {$<$} .001) and slower rates of change. Different shapes of change were also evidenced: Curvilinear responses were more often found in shorter treatments, while linear shapes were more often found in longer treatments. However, findings varied depending on methodological criteria used. Although rates of change varied in line with the GEL, most people nonetheless responded within defined boundaries as described in the dose-response literature. We therefore refer to the notion of "boundaried responsive regulation" to describe the relationship between treatment duration and outcomes.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the published material on practice-based research and to compare results with benchmarks derived from efficacy studies. METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were carried out up to and including 2008. Studies were screened for content relevance and selected according to specified inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from all studies that met criteria and were quality assessed using an adapted version of a checklist designed for the appraisal of both randomized and non-randomized studies of health care interventions. Studies were synthesized according to (1) the type of problem being treated and (2) study design using descriptive and meta-analytic methods where appropriate. RESULTS: Psychological treatment conducted in routine clinic settings is effective for a range of client problems, particularly common mental health problems (uncontrolled effect size = 1.29; 95\% CI = 1.26-1.33, N = 10,842). When benchmarked against data from efficacy studies, practice-based studies yielded effect sizes that fell short of the selected benchmark. In contrast, the practice-based studies achieved the benchmark for percentage of clients meeting a stringent criterion for recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Clients receiving treatment as normally delivered within routine practice report significant relief of symptoms. However, the result of comparisons with efficacy benchmarks is dependent on the outcome index used. Notwithstanding this, substantive factors are also likely to contribute. Therefore, in addition to attending to methodological issues, further work is required to understand the relative contribution of these factors.},

The short- and long-term effects of feedback on symptom reduction were investi\- gated using 58 (randomized and non-randomized) studies, analyzing 110 effect sizes in a total of 21,699 patients. Effects of feedback on dropout rate, percentage of deteriorated cases, and treatment duration were also exam\- ined. Moderation analyses were conducted for study and feedback characteristics. A small significant effect of progress feedback on symptom reduction (d = 0.15, 95\% CI: [0.10, 0.20]) was found, compared to control groups. This was also true for not-on-track cases (d = 0.17, 95\% CI: [0.11, 0.22]). In addition, feedback had a small favorable effect on dropout rates (OR = 1.19, 95\% CI: [1.03, 1.38]). The moderation analyses identified several potentially interesting variables for further research, including feedback instrument, outcome instrument, type of feedback, feedback frequency, treatment intensity, and country in which the study was conducted. Future studies should report on these variables more consistently so that we can obtain a better understanding of when and why feedback improves outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Policy developments in recent years have led to important changes in the level of access to evidence-based psychological treatments. Several methods have been used to investigate the effectiveness of these treatments in routine care, with different approaches to outcome definition and data analysis. Aims: To present a review of challenges and methods for the evaluation of evidence-based treatments delivered in routine mental healthcare. This is followed by a case example of a benchmarking method applied in primary care. Method: High, average and poor performance benchmarks were calculated through a meta-analysis of published data from services working under the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Programme in England. Pre-post treatment effect sizes (ES) and confidence intervals were estimated to illustrate a benchmarking method enabling services to evaluate routine clinical outcomes. Results: High, average and poor performance ES for routine IAPT services were estimated to be 0.91, 0.73 and 0.46 for depression (using PHQ-9) and 1.02, 0.78 and 0.52 for anxiety (using GAD-7). Data from one specific IAPT service exemplify how to evaluate and contextualize routine clinical performance against these benchmarks. Conclusions: The main contribution of this report is to summarize key recommendations for the selection of an adequate set of psychometric measures, the operational definition of outcomes, and the statistical evaluation of clinical performance. A benchmarking method is also presented, which may enable a robust evaluation of clinical performance against national benchmarks. Some limitations concerned significant heterogeneity among data sources, and wide variations in ES and data completeness.},

Several psychological interventions are available, but there is a lack of evidence to decide which treatment works best for whom. This study aimed to identify subgroups of patients who respond differentially to cognitive\textendash behavioral therapy (CBT) or person-centered counseling for depression (CfD). Method: This was a retrospective analysis of archival routine practice data for 1,435 patients who received either CBT (N = 1,104) or CfD (N = 331) in primary care. The main outcome was posttreatment reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) in the PHQ-9 depression measure. A targeted prescription algorithm was developed in a training sample (N = 1,085) using a supervised machine learning approach (elastic net with optimal scaling). The clinical utility of the algorithm was examined in a statistically independent test sample (N = 350) using chi-square analysis and odds ratios. Results: Cases in the test sample that received their model-indicated ``optimal'' treatment had a significantly higher RCSI rate (62.5\%) compared to those who received the ``suboptimal'' treatment (41.7\%); {$\chi$}2(df = 1) = 4.79, p = .03, OR = 2.33 (95\% CI [1.09, 5.02]). Conclusion: Targeted prescription has the potential to make best use of currently available evidence-based treatments, improving outcomes for patients at no additional cost to psychological services.

Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes research studies published in the last 10 years. Results Seventeen studies including 165,574 patients measured at least one indicator of SES and its relationship with psychological therapy outcomes. Twelve of these studies found significant relationships between SES measures and mental health outcomes. Six studies focusing on employment status offered sufficient quantitative information to conduct meta-analysis. The overall effect of employment was not significant (-0.66, confidence of interval (CI) -1.33, 0.02). A sensitivity analysis (k = 5) showed a small effect (-0.22, CI -0.36, -0.09) of employment on treatment outcomes. Conclusions There is some evidence to indicate that socioeconomic deprivation is associated with poorer treatment outcomes, although limitations of the available data warrant treating this as a preliminary conclusion.},

Method: The sample comprised 26,888 patients, seen by 462 therapists, across 30 clinics. Mean patient age was 38 years (69\% female, 90\% White, 92\% planned ending). The dependent variable was patients' post-therapy score on the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation \textendash{} Outcome Measure. An incremental three-level multilevel model was constructed. Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation created 95\% probability intervals for the clinic and therapist effects. Results: A three-level model with no explanatory variables detected a clinic effect of 8.2\%, significantly larger than the therapist effect of 3.2\%. Adding explanatory variables significantly reduced the clinic effect to 1.9\% but did not significantly alter the therapist effect (3.4\%). Patient-level symptom severity and employment status, and clinic-level percentage of White patients and healthcare sector explained the most clinic outcome variance and overall outcome variance. Conclusions: Substantial variability in clinical outcomes was found between clinics providing psychological therapy. Socioeconomic mix of patients explained significant proportions of variability at the clinic level but not the therapist level. Clinical implications include the need to go beyond the therapist-patient interaction in order to deliver effective psychological therapy. Future research is also needed to identify the mechanisms by which clinic and/or area-level factors impact on clinical outcomes.},

The sample comprised routine clinical data from 26,814 patients (69\% female; mean age 38) and 466 therapists in five care sectors: primary care, secondary care, university, voluntary, and workplace.

There were no other significant differences detected between care sectors. These findings support the hypothesis that differences in effectiveness between therapists vary depending on the context in which psychological treatment is provided. Differences in relative therapist impact can vary by a factor of 4\textendash 8 across treatment sectors.

Despite numerous cross-sectional studies examining this question, no large-scale longitudinal study has assessed within-therapist changes in outcomes over time. Method: The present study examined changes in psychotherapists' outcomes over time using a large, longitudinal, naturalistic psychotherapy data set. The sample included 6,591 patients seen in individual psychotherapy by 170 therapists who had on average 4.73 years of data in the data set (range = 0.44 to 17.93 years). Patient-level outcomes were examined using the Outcome Questionnaire-45 and a standardized metric of change (prepost d). Two-level multilevel models (patients nested within therapist) were used to examine the relationship between therapist experience and patient prepost d and early termination. Experience was examined both as chronological time and cumulative patients seen. Results: Therapists achieved outcomes comparable with benchmarks from clinical trials. However, a very small but statistically significant change in outcome was detected indicating that on the whole, therapists' patient prepost d tended to diminish as experience (time or cases) increases. This small reduction remained when controlling for several patient-level, caseload-level, and therapist-level characteristics, as well as when excluding several types of outliers. Further, therapists were shown to vary significantly across time, with some therapists showing improvement despite the overall tendency for outcomes to decline. In contrast, therapists showed lower rates of early termination as experience increased. Conclusions: Implications of these findings for the development of expertise in psychotherapy are explored.},

According to this concept, episodes of temporary destabilization represent a precondition for abrupt changes within the therapeutic process. The authors examined six courses of therapy (patients diagnosed with depression and personality disorder). After each therapy session, patients rated their experience of the therapeutic interaction. A measure of instability was used to identify episodes of destabilization with respect to patients' interaction experience throughout the process. Episodes of pronounced destabilization occurred in the four courses of therapy that showed better therapy outcomes. These episodes were characterized by temporary strong deteriorations in interaction experience (negative peaks). Three of the four courses showed subsequent discontinuous improvements to a higher level of interaction. Results indicate that the systematic inclusion of a measure of instability is worthwhile in investigations of discontinuous changes.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper sought to conduct a meta-analysis of the effectiveness and durability of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) and assess the acceptability of CAT in terms of dropout rates. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PROSPERO registration: CRD42018086009. Searches identified CAT treatment outcome studies eligible to be narratively synthesized. Pre-post/post-follow-up effect sizes (ESs) were extracted and synthesized in a random-effects meta-analysis. Variations in effect sizes were explored using moderator analyses. Dropout rates were extracted. Secondary analyses synthesized between-group ES from trials of CAT. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies providing pre-post CAT treatment outcomes were aggregated across three outcome comparisons of functioning, depression, and interpersonal problems. CAT produced large pre-post improvements in global functioning (ES~=~0.86; 95\% CI 0.71-1.01, N~=~628), moderate-to-large improvements in interpersonal problems (ES~=~0.74, 95\% CI 0.51-0.97, N~=~460), and large reductions in depression symptoms (ES~=~1.05, 95\% CI 0.80-1.29, N~=~586). All these effects were maintained or improved upon at follow-up. Limited moderators of CAT treatment effect were identified. CAT demonstrated small-moderate, significant post-treatment benefits compared to comparators in nine clinical trials (ES~=~0.36-0.53; N~=~352). The average dropout rate for CAT was 16\% (range 0-33\%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a range of presenting problems appear to experience durable improvements in their difficulties after undergoing CAT. Recommendations are provided to guide the further progression of the CAT outcome evidence base. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Large pre-post reductions in global functioning and depression outcomes and moderate-large reductions in interpersonal problems are evident after CAT. The effects of CAT appear durable, and interpersonal functioning significantly improves over follow-up time. CAT produces small-moderate benefits compared to trial comparators. CAT appears to be an engaging psychotherapy that maintains patients in treatment.},

  abstract = {Background. Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP), as developed by Habib Davanloo, is an intensive emotion-focused psychodynamic therapy with an explicit focus on handling resistance in treatment. A core assumption in ISTDP is that psychotherapeutic effects are dependent on in-session emotional processing in the form of rise in complex transference feelings that occurs when treatment resistance is challenged. Recent research indicates that an unlocking of the unconscious, a powerful emotional breakthrough achieved at a high rise in complex transference feelings, can potentially enhance ISTDP's effectiveness. While ISTDP has a growing evidence base, most of the research conducted has used small samples and has tested therapy delivered by expert therapists. The aims of this study were to evaluate the overall effectiveness of ISTDP when delivered in a tertiary psychotherapy service, and to investigate if having an unlocking of the unconscious during therapy predicted enhanced treatment effectiveness. Methods. A total of 412 patients were included in the analyses. The average length of treatment was 10.2 sessions (SD 13.3). Multilevel growth curve modeling was used to evaluate treatment effectiveness and the association between unlocking the unconscious and outcome. A number of control predictors including type of treatment resistance were selected and included in the analyses. Outcome measures were the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP). About half of the patients in the study were treated by therapists in training and the other half by more experienced therapists. Results. Growth curve analyses using the full intention-to-treat sample revealed significant within-group effects of ISTDP on both the BSI and the IIP. Effect sizes were large ({$>$}0.80). Unlocking the unconscious during therapy was associated with significantly larger treatment outcome. The relationship was further moderated by type of treatment resistance. Conclusion. This study adds to the empirical base of Davanloo's ISTDP with confirmed treatment effectiveness in a large-scale patient sample when ISTDP was delivered by therapists with a range of experience.

Results Twenty studies met inclusion criteria (3 RCTs; 17 practice-based) with 19 studies using multilevel modeling. TEs were found in 19 studies. The TE range for all studies was 0.2\% to 29\% (weighted average = 5\%). For RCTs, 1\%\textendash 29\% (weighted average = 8.2\%). For practice-based studies, 0.2\textendash 21\% (weighted average = 5\%). The university counseling subsample yielded a lower TE (2.4\%) than in other groupings (i.e., primary care, mixed clinical settings, and specialist/focused settings). Therapist sample sizes remained lower than recommended, and few studies appeared to be designed specifically as TE studies, with too few examples of maximising the research potential of large routine patient datasets. Conclusions Therapist effects are a robust phenomenon although considerable heterogeneity exists across studies. Patient severity appeared related to TE size. TEs from RCTs were highly variable. Using an overall therapist effects statistic may lack precision, and TEs might be better reported separately for specific clinical settings.},

This study set out to test these claims. METHODS: A single-blind randomized and controlled dismantling trial investigated treatment outcomes for moderate to severely depressed patients receiving CAT in Primary Care. Ninety-five participants were randomized to either full-CAT (n = 52) or CAT minus narrative reformulation (CAT-NR, n = 43). Treatment duration in both arms was 8-sessions and was matched apart from the omission of the NR in the CAT-NR arm. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with secondary outcome measures of anxiety, functioning, helpfulness and the therapeutic alliance. Outcomes were assessed at screening, every treatment session and at 8-weeks follow-up. RESULTS: Growth curve modelling found that NR did not enhance the efficacy of CAT for depression. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of attendance, adverse events, anxiety, functioning, helpfulness or therapeutic alliance. There were large within-group effect sizes (d+ {$>$} 1.5), as CAT with or without NR produced significant reductions in depression (p {$<$} .01). LIMITATIONS: The primary outcome were assessed via self-report and the follow-up period was brief. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that NR may be redundant when treating depression with CAT. Whilst a brief 8-session version of the CAT model appears suitable for treating depression in Primary Care, further research regarding the need for NR is indicated.},

  abstract = {A program of research aimed at improving the quality of psychological interventions is described. Data from over 10,000 patients were analyzed to understand the association between number of treatment sessions and clinically significant improvement. In addition to a potential dose-response relationship, typical recovery curves were generated for patients at varying levels of disturbance and were used to identify patients whose progress was less than expected ("signal" cases). The consequences of passing this information along to therapists were reported. Analyses of dose-response data showed that 50\% of patients required 21 sessions of treatment before they met criteria for clinically significant improvement. Seventy-five percent of patients were predicted to improve only after receiving more than 40 treatment sessions in conjunction with other routine contacts, including medication in some cases. Identification of signal cases (potential treatment failures) shows promise as a decision support tool, although further research is needed to elucidate the nature of helpful feedback. Outgrowths of this research include its possible contribution to social policy decisions, reductions in the need for case management, use in supervision, and possible effects on theories of change.

In response to the need for valid measures of psychotherapy outcome in routine practice, Lambert and associates developed the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45; Lambert, Hansen, et al. 1996), a 45-item self-report instrument that requires patients to rate their functioning on a 5-point Likert scale. The OQ-45 was designed to access common symptoms across a wide range of adult mental disorders and syndromes, including stress-related illness. In addition, the OQ-45 was designed to be used as a baseline screening instrument with application in primary care for alerting physicians to the need for referral for psychological interventions. However, it was not developed for use as a diagnostic tool. Diagnosis is a task better served by traditional diagnostic practices, including the use of more appropriate instruments, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI; Lambert, Burlingame, et al., 1996).

Psychiatric symptoms and interpersonal problems were assessed at three time points. Healthcare data from baseline year and three years following treatment came from independent governmental databases. Results: Multilevel models indicated significant reductions in symptoms and interpersonal problems during treatment, including a moderate to large pre-post effect size (d = .76) for somatization. Further, the sample had successive reductions in yearly healthcare costs, reaching the normal population mean two years post treatment. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the uncontrolled design, our study suggest ISTDP may be both clinically effective and cost-effective for patients with chronic pain.},

In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size.

In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.},

Method: A total of 10,854 clients completed a measure of psychological functioning before each session. Psychological functioning was measured by the Behavioral Health Measure,which is an index of well-being, symptoms, and life-functioning. Clients who attended 5 to 25 sessions at 46 different university/college counseling centers and one community mental health center were included in this study. Client diagnoses and the specific treatment approaches were not known. Results: A 3-class solution was a good fit to the data. Clients in classes 1 and 3 had moderate severity in their initial psychological functioning scores, and clients in class 2 had more distressed psychological functioning scores. The trajectory for clients in class 1 was typified by early initial change, followed by a plateau, and then another gain in psychological functioning later in treatment. The trajectory for clients in class 2 demonstrated an initial decrease in functioning, followed by a rapid increase, and then a plateau. Last, the clients in class 3 had a steady increase of psychological functioning, in a more linear manner. Conclusion: The trajectories of change for clients are diverse, and they can ebb and flow more than traditional dose-effect and good-enough level models may suggest.

Methods: Full pre\textendash post data were available on 62 out of a total of 67 patients aged between 19 and 60 years. Patients were seen over a 52-month period (2001\textendash 2005) receiving a course of PIT therapy (mean number of sessions = 16:9, median number of sessions = 16). The outcomes were assessed using a range of outcome measures: the 32-item version of the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32), the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), and the Beck Depression Inventory\textemdash Second Edition (BDI-II). Study data were benchmarked against comparative national and local data. Results: There were significant pre\textendash post reductions on all measures: IIP-32 effect size (ES) = 0:56; CORE\textendash OM ES = 0:76; BDI\textendash II ES = 0:76. Reliable and clinically significant change was achieved by 34\%of clients on the BDI-II and by 40\% of client son the CORE-OM. Clients with high pre-therapy levels of interpersonal problems had poorer outcomes. Conclusion: Benchmarking our results against both national and local comparative data showed that our results were less favourable than those obtained where PIT had been used in efficacy trials, but were comparable with reports of other therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) in routine practice settings. The results show that PIT can yield acceptable clinical outcomes, comparable to CBT in a routine care setting, within the context of current limitations of the practice-based evidence paradigm.

Proponents of psychoanalysis, treatment by persuasion, Christian science and any number of other psychotherapeutic ideologies can point to notable successes. The implication of this fact is not, however, univocal. The proud proponent, having achieved success in the cases he mentions, implies, even when he does not say it, that his ideology is thus proved true, all others false. More detached observers, on the other hand, surveying the whole field tend, on logical grounds, to draw a very different conclusion. If such theoretically conflicting procedures, they reason, can lead to success, often even in similar cases, then therapeutic result is not a reliable guide to the validity of theory. It takes but little reflection to arrive at the roots of the difficulty from the standpoint of logical deduction. Not only is it sound to believe that the same conclusion cannot follow from opposite premises but when such a contradiction appears, as seems to be true in the present instance, it is justifiable to wonder (whether the factors alleged to be operating in a given therapy are identical with the factors that actually are operating and whether the factors that actually are operating in several different therapies may not have much more in common than have the factors alleged to be operating.

The chapter illustrates the use of CAT with a brief case history, including the extension of CAT into more contextual and systemic settings, group work, and reflective practice, with a focus on individual psychotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background\hspace{0.6em} Routine outcome monitoring can support clinicians to detect patients who deteriorate [not-on-track (NOT)] early in psychotherapy. Implemented Clinical Support Tools can direct clinicians' attention towards potential obstacles to a positive treatment outcome and provide suggestions for suitable interventions. However, few studies have compared NOT patients to patients showing expected progress [on-track (OT)] regarding such obstacles. This study aimed to identify domains that have predictive value for NOT trajectories and to compare OT and NOT patients regarding these domains and the items of the underlying scales. Methods\hspace{0.6em} During treatment, 413 outpatients filled in the Hopkins-Symptom-Checklist-11 (depressive and anxious symptom distress) before every therapy session as a routine outcome measure. Further, the Assessment for Signal Clients, Affective Style Questionnaire, and Outcome Questionnaire-30 were applied every fifth session. These questionnaires measure the following domains, which were investigated as potential obstacles to treatment success: risk/suicidality, therapeutic alliance, motivation, social support and life events, as well as emotion regulation. Two groups (OT and NOT patients) were formed by defining a cut-off (failure boundary) as the 90\% confidence interval (upper bound) of the respective patients' expected recovery curves. In order to differentiate group membership based on the respective problem areas, multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed. Further, OT and NOT patients were compared with regard to the domains' and items' cut-offs by performing Pearson chi-square tests and independent samples t-tests. Results\hspace{0.6em} The life events and motivation scale as well as the risk/suicidality scale proved to be significant predictors of being not-on-track. NOT patients also crossed the cut-off significantly more often on the domains risk/suicidality, social support, and life events. For both OT and NOT patients, the emotion regulation domain's cut-off was most commonly exceeded. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Life events, motivation, and risk/suicidality seem to be directly linked to treatment failure and should be further investigated for the use in clinical support tools.},

Method: Study 1 derived aggregated uncontrolled effect sizes and clinically significant change rates for the CBT and control conditions of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with critical values for demonstrating equivalence to RCTs and superiority to control conditions for anxiety disorders and depression. Study 2 provided benchmarks for demonstrating equivalence, and superiority to other student clinics. Study 3 calculated outcome effect sizes and clinically significant change rates of 342 consecutive CTAD clients allocated to student psychologists between 2009 and 2015, who provided at least two questionnaires, attended at least three sessions and were primarily seen by a student therapist. Aggregated point prevalence estimates of key demographic characteristics of studies contributing to benchmarks were provided. Results: RCT CBT produced higher effect sizes than student clinics, but similar rates of clinically significant change. The application of benchmarking to CTAD illustrated that evaluations of student psychologist effectiveness would differ depending on the benchmark used. Conclusion: We have provided best-available benchmarks for evaluating student-led adult outpatient CBT which we encourage other student clinics to adopt. The benchmarking approach provided a profile of CTAD's strengths and weaknesses. Examples of how benchmark comparisons could be used to inform service improvement were provided.},

Fifty-six effectiveness studies of CBT for adult anxiety disorders were located and synthesized. Meta-analytic effect sizes are presented for disorder-specific symptom measures as well as symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression for each disorder, and benchmarked to results from randomized controlled trials. All pretest-posttest effect sizes for disorder-specific symptom measures were large, suggesting that CBT for adult anxiety disorders is effective in clinically representative conditions. Six studies included a control group, and between-groups comparisons yielded large effect sizes for disorder-specific symptoms in favor of CBT. Benchmarking indicated that results from effectiveness studies were in the range of those obtained in selected efficacy trials. To test whether studies that are more representative of clinical settings have smaller effect sizes, the authors coded studies for 9 criteria for clinical representativeness. Results indicate an inverse relationship between clinical representativeness and outcome, but the magnitude of the relationship is quite small.},

We compared the outcomes of contrasting approaches practised in routine care. METHOD: Patients (n = 1309) who received cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), person-centred therapy (PCT) and psychodynamic therapy (PDT) at one of 58 National Health Service (NHS) primary and secondary care sites in the UK during a 3-year period completed the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) at the beginning and end of their treatment. Therapists indicated which treatment approaches were used on an End of Therapy form. We compared outcomes of six groups: three treated with CBT, PCT or PDT only, and three treated with one of these plus one additional approach (e.g. integrative, supportive, art), designated CBT+1, PCT+1 or PDT+1 respectively. RESULTS: All six groups averaged marked improvement (pre-post effect size = 1.36). Treatment approach and degree of purity ('only' vs. '+1') each accounted for statistically significant but comparatively tiny proportions of the variance in CORE-OM scores (respectively 1\% and 0.5\% as much as pre-post change). Distributions of change scores were largely overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: Results for these three treatment approaches as practised routinely across a range of NHS settings were generally consistent with previous findings that theoretically different approaches tend to have equivalent outcomes. Caution is warranted because of limited treatment specification, non-random assignment, lack of a control group, missing data and other issues.},

Rates of RCSI and reliable improvement and mean pre- and post-treatment changes were similar at all tested treatment durations.

This paper sought to review and meta-analyse practice-based evidence arising from the programme. Design A pre-registered (CRD42018114796) systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A random effects meta-analysis was performed only on the practice-based IAPT studies (i.e. excluding the clinical trials). Subgroup analyses examined the potential influence of particular methodologies, treatments, populations, and target conditions. Sensitivity analyses investigated potential sources of heterogeneity and bias. Results The systematic review identified N = 60 studies, with N = 47 studies suitable for meta-analysis. The primary meta-analysis showed large pre-post treatment effect sizes for depression (d = 0.87, 95\% CI [0.78\textendash 0.96], p {$<$} .0001) and anxiety (d = 0.88, 95\% CI [0.79\textendash 0.97], p {$<$} .0001), and a moderate effect on functional impairment (d = 0.55, 95\% CI [0.48\textendash 0.61], p {$<$} .0001). The methodological features of studies influenced ESs (e.g., such as whether intention-to-treat or completer analyses were employed). Conclusions Current evidence suggests that IAPT enables access to broadly effective evidence-based psychological therapies for large numbers of patients. The limitations of the review and the clinical and methodological implications are discussed. Practitioner points IAPT interventions are associated with large pre-post treatment effect sizes in depression and anxiety measures. IAPT interventions are associated with moderate treatment effect sizes with regards to work and social adjustment. A reduction in dropout and also the prevention of post-treatment relapse via the offer of follow-up support are important areas for future development.},

  abstract = {Objective: The Clinical Support Tools (CSTs) were developed to help therapists organize and target potential problems that might account for negative outcomes in psychotherapy. The core of CST feedback is the Assessment for Signal Clients. The purpose of this study was to describe and identify patterns of problems that typically characterize off-track cases. Method: The responses and scores from 107 off-track clients from a hospital-based outpatient clinic were analyzed. Results: A cluster analysis of the 107 off-track clients revealed three client types: those whose problems were characterized by alliance and motivational difficulties; those characterized by social support and life event difficulties; and those whose problems had an indistinguishable pattern. Log-linear modeling showed that if patients had less therapeutic alliance problems they were also less likely to have motivational problems. Findings were also consistent with the cluster analysis, which showed that a relatively higher percentage of not-on-track participants received signal alerts for the social support items and scale. Conclusions: Individuals whose progress goes off-track while in psychotherapy appear to have their greatest difficulty with social support, followed closely by motivation for therapy and therapeutic alliance.},

  abstract = {Objective: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) reduces fatigue and disability in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, outcomes vary between studies, possibly because of differences in patient characteristics, treatment protocols, diagnostic criteria and outcome measures. The objective was to compare outcomes after CBT in tertiary treatment centres in the Netherlands (NL) and the United Kingdom (UK), using different treatment protocols but identical outcome measures, while controlling for differences in patient characteristics and diagnostic criteria.Methods: Consecutively referred CFS patients who received CBT were included (NL: n=293, UK: n=163). Uncontrolled effect sizes for improvement in fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire), physical functioning (SF-36 physical functioning subscale) and social functioning (Work and Social Adjustment Scale) were compared. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine whether patient differences explained outcome differences between centres.Results: Effect sizes differed between centres for fatigue (Cohen's D NL=1.74, 95\% CI=1.52-1.95; UK=0.99, CI=0.73-1.25), physical functioning (NL=0.99, CI=0.81-1.18; UK=0.33, CI=0.08-0.58) and social functioning (NL=1.47, CI=1.26-1.69; UK=0.61, CI=0.35-0.86). Patients in the UK had worse physical functioning at baseline and there were minor demographic differences. These could not explain differences in centre outcome.Conclusion: Effectiveness of CBT differed between treatment centres. Differences in treatment protocols may explain this and should be investigated to help further improve outcomes.},
